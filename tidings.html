<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Alfie, would you please bring up a couple of bottles of wine from the storeroom while I mix this stuffing?</font color="#C0C0C0"><p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Of course dear. I wonder if Eliot's new girlfriend drinks alcohol?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">I have no idea. Why shouldn't she?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Eliot said she is a vegan.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">That doesn't mean she doesn't drink alcohol. As far as I know, nobody makes alcoholic drinks from a living creature.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">No, I suppose you are right.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">In any case, even if she doesn't drink that shouldn't stop us<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">No, of course not. I just wondered. ( short pause) That stuffing smells delicious already.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0"> Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">I am going to add some chestnut to it<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Mmmm I bet that will taste good.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">The turkey is about thawed now so that will be ready for the oven soon, and need to get the vegetables peeled<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Anything I can do to help?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Yes Alfie! Go get the wine.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Alright, alright I was just going. What time are they supposed to be arriving?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Eliot and Bethany?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">They should be here at about 3pm<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Plenty of time to get things done then.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">There should be if you just go get the wine<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">It will be a bit funny having a stranger here for Christmas<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Do you mean Bethany? Well, she is not a stranger to Eliot<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">No, but she is to us.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Well I am sure it will all seem perfectly normal once they arrive.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">( She has let herself through the kitchen door) Coooeeee, only me.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Hello Miriam, merry Christmas<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> And merry Christmas to you both<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Merry Christmas Miriam. Got your turkey in the oven yet?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Not yet, plenty of time. Are you making your own stuffing then Joan?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes, I am going to add some chestnut in a moment<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Oh you don't want to add chestnut, you should add walnut<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">I prefer chestnut<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">I read on the internet that walnut is better<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Don't believe all you read on the internet. I read that Elvis is alive and well and living in a camper van on the banks of the Nile<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Don't be silly Alfie.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">Anyway, I popped round to ask you a favour.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> What can we do for you?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Could I possible borrow some sugar from you? I completely forgot I was out of it when I went shopping<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes of course, brown or white? We have plenty<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">Brown if that's ok?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Alfie, will you get the sugar for Miriam.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes of course, always happy to help a neighbour.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Thanks Alfie.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Here you are, is one pack enough?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes plenty, I'll replace it after Christmas.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0"> Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> No rush<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Ohh you haven't got your turkey in the oven yet<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan. <font color="#C0C0C0">No, not yet<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> You should hurry then you have guest coming don't you?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan<font color="#C0C0C0"> yes but all in plenty of time.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">Well I'd best be off then See you later<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0"> Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Bye Miriam.(pause)<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Oh thank goodness she's gone. She always thinks she knows better than anyone else.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Yes I can see you are a bit flustered. Anything I can do?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> YES!!! go get the wine<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Red or white?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> I don't care if it is sky blue pink – just go get some.</font color="#C0C0C0"><p>



<i>Scene two – Eliot's car. </1><p>

<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> So tell me Eliot, what are they like?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Who?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> You know who, your mum and dad. You have told me virtually nothing about them<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Well my dad is the one to be careful of <p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Oh really? Why?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Well, I told you about him being in prison didn't I?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Prison!!!! No you never told me that<p>

<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">I am sure I must have done.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">No never. What was he in for? He is not still there is he?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Oh no, got out three months ago<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Oh my gosh. What did he do?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> One of our neighbours annoyed him so dad shot him<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> SHOT HIM!!!<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yeh, Dad can be a bit impulsive at times.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> What did the neighbour do?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">He kept putting the recycling bins out on the wrong day<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">And your dad shot him for that!!!!!<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> To be honest, I thought that was a bit of overreacting too. Probably could have just had a word with him first<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">How long was he in prison for?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Fifteen years. Sentence was reduced for good behaviour. He was lucky really<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Lucky? Why?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Because two years before that he murdered another neighbour.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Another one? How many neighbours has he murdered?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Oh just the two, he is not a violent man<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> He does seem to get upset easily. He won't murder me will he<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">No, no. That is very unlikely.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> UNLIKELY!!! what do you mean unlikely?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">It's Christmas isn't it. I am sure he wouldn't murder anyone at Christmas<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">(very sternly) Eliot, turn around right now. Right now please. I want to go home</font color="#C0C0C0"><p>

<i>Scene Three: The Kitchen</i><p>

<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Alfie, can I assume you are just about to get the wine? <p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">You assume correctly darling that is going to be my very next job<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">What do you mean your next job? You haven't done anything at all yet</font color="#C0C0C0"><p>
( There is a loud banging for the top floor)<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0">That'll be your mother<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> (Loudly) What do you want mum?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Can I have a cup of coffee please<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">We are rather busy mum can you come down for it?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">There's the stairs<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">We know there are stairs Edna, that's how we manage to get to the bedrooms<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna:<font color="#C0C0C0"> I am only asking for a cup of coffee. Is it too much to for ask at my age? I am eighty three you know.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">We know you are eighty three, you reminded us an hour ago<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Oh take her up of coffee Alfie<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Ok<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Cooeeee. Only me again<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">What do you want this time Miriam?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">Just popped round for a chat really. Charley is having a nap and I don't like to disturb him<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Don't worry about disturbing us though<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Alfie, don't be so rude.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Sorry. Would you like a coffee? I am just making one for Edna?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">Thanks very much Alfie, I'd love one. Is it instant?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes it is<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0"> Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">We never have instant, always make it fresh in our house<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: (shouting) <font color="#C0C0C0">Is my coffee ready yet<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Just doing it now<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">Oh don't bother yourself, I'll come down<p></font color="#C0C0C0">

                                                                               <i>Scene four – Eliot's car</i><p>

<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Don't be so silly Beth. I was joking<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Really?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Elliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes of course I was. My dad wouldn't hurt a fly<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">Well it wasn't very funny. You had me really worried<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">It was so ridiculous I didn't think you would believe me.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">I did and I feel very silly now. That was not a nice thing to do, especially at Christmas<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Ok sorry but I was just trying to be funny.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> I hope they like me.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Of course they will. We'll be there soon<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Good. I am so looking forward to meeting them all. I bet you are looking forward to the roast turkey<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:Roast turkey?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes, I know you adore that, Turkey and roast potato's and all the trimmings<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Oh dear.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">What do you mean 'Oh dear'<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">I should have mentioned it before I suppose but I didn't think<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Mentioned what?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Well, I should have told you before, we don't have the traditional Christmas dinner<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">Why ever not? <p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">We haven't done that since mum lost her arm so we normally send out for a Chinese take-away<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">Ohh. Eliot, how did that happen?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> On their 25th wedding anniversary they decided to have the trip of a lifetime and went for a cruise along the Amazon<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> That sounds wonderful<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Not really. One night mum got drunk and fell overboard<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Oh no<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">She was attacked by a crocodile and he chewed off most of her arm<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> ELIOT!!! are you joking again?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Well just a bit – she does still have both arms and there will be a turkey dinner</font color="#C0C0C0"><p>

<i>Scene five – The Kitchen</i><p>

<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">I don't like to be a nuisance so I came down for my tea. Hello Miriam, merry Christmas<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Merry Christmas Edna, you're looking well.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">Thank you Miriam, I am 83 you know?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Really? I had no idea. Anyway you said you wanted coffee not tea<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">No, I distinctly said tea<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">You did say Coffee mum.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna:<font color="#C0C0C0"> I am sure I said tea. That's what happens when  you get old. I am 83 now you know<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Really? I would never have guessed. Don't worry though I'll make you tea.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0"> Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">I hope I am like you when  I am 83<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: (very quietly) <font color="#C0C0C0">I bloody don't<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Mum, sit sown there and Alfie will bring your tea over.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Thank you dear, it is as much as I can do to sit down.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes, and you have the same trouble standing up, here's your tea.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">Thank you. Sorry to be such a trouble<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">You are no trouble at all mum it is just so nice to have you here for Christmas. Now, I should get that turkey in the oven.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">Have you basted it?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes Miriam, of course I have  basted it.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Oh ok, I don't like to interfere<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes, I had noticed that<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">Who else is coming? <p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">We told you yesterday mum, Eliot and his new girlfriend.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">Very nice, What's her name:<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Bethany, and she is a vegan<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">Where's vegan?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> It's not a place Edna. It means she doesn't eat meat<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Or any dairy products<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">What's she going to eat then?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">I don't know, maybe the tablecloth.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Don't be silly Alfie. I have prepared a special vegan meal for her.<p> 
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam: <font color="#C0C0C0">I don't think I could be vegan. I love my food too much<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">I am probably almost vegan I eat so little. You don't have much of an appetite when you are 83<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0"> Alfie:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Is that how old you are then Edna? I didn't realise<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan: <font color="#C0C0C0">Shut up Alfie and go get the wine</font color="#C0C0C0"><p>

<i>Scene Six – Eliot's car</i>

<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Almost there now, only another couple of miles.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Do they know I am a vegan?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Yes, don't worry. I told mum when I first told her you were coming.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> I bet she thinks I am being very awkward<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Not at all, she is very good at coping with things like that<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">With both arms I presume<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Exactly. My grandma may find it a bit odd though<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> That your mum has two arms?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">No, that you are vegan<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> I can understand that, a lot of people find it odd.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">You will love them all though, I promise<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">I just hope they like me<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">Don't worry about that, I know they will<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> I wish I had been more imaginative about a present<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">They'll love it<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">Two bottles of wine is not exactly groundbreaking<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">They both like wine so it will go down very well<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany: <font color="#C0C0C0">I hope so. Is it much further?<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">No, almost there now, another 10 minutes.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Bethany:<font color="#C0C0C0"> I am kind of nervous and excited at the same time<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Eliot: <font color="#C0C0C0">I promise you, they will be very welcoming and make you feel very much at home</font color="#C0C0C0"><p>

<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">It is tea Edna, that's what you asked for.<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Edna: <font color="#C0C0C0">I am sure I asked for coffee<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Miriam:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Definitely tea Edna. I heard you<p>

<font color="#FFFDD0">Joan:<font color="#C0C0C0"> Plenty big enough thanks Miriam<p>
<font color="#FFFDD0">Alfie: <font color="#C0C0C0">We never have a really big one otherwise you end up having turkey for the next three weeks<p>
